# public_water_system_boundaries
A repository to develop a first-cut U.S. national scale layer of water system boundaries 

This repository houses workflow software for compilation of public water system boundaries. The output of this workflow will generate a national layer of public water system boundaries. 

In addition Persistent Identifiers for the geoconnex.us system, reference landing page content for the reference.geoconnex.us system, and a set of best available links to relevant hydrologic and administrative data may be managed.

These features are intended to be a shared community resource that anyone can contribute to. If a boundary does not exist and data are collected there, the boundary can and should be contributed such that others can reference the boundary.
